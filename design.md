# Bewild Design Strategy

## Design Philosophy
BeWild’s design strategy centers around evoking a sense of nature, purity, and sustainability. The interface should be minimal, clean, and rich with earthy tones. Our tone blend is: **Approachable (40%)**, **Assertive (30%)**, **Authentic (30%)**. We aim to create an immersive digital storefront that feels honest and grounded.

### Cards
- Clean edge or softly rounded corners
- Muted box shadows (natural look)
- Use icons over images when possible
